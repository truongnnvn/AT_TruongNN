import RealmSwift

/**
 A Realm instance (also referred to as "a realm") represents a Realm
 database.

 Realms can either be stored on disk (see `init(path:)`) or in
 memory (see `Configuration`).

 Realm instances are cached internally, and constructing equivalent Realm
 objects (with the same path or identifier) produces limited overhead.

 If you specifically want to ensure a Realm object is
 destroyed (for example, if you wish to open a realm, check some property, and
 then possibly delete the realm file and re-open it), place the code which uses
 the realm within an `autoreleasepool {}` and ensure you have no other
 strong references to it.

 - warning: Realm instances are not thread safe and can not be shared across
 threads or dispatch queues. You must construct a new instance on each thread you want
 to interact with the realm on. For dispatch queues, this means that you must
 call it in each block which is dispatched, as a queue is not guaranteed to run
 on a consistent thread.
